# What's this?

A PowerShell update script for Open-WebUI deployments made using Podman / Podman Desktop; this automates the update process and still preserves your chat sessions and settings. You will however have to log in again (that hasn't been addressed yet).

# Current Limitations

- Not yet configured to work with HTTPS.
- You have to log in again after the update because that persistent data is erased.
